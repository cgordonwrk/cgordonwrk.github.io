		<h2>About Me</h2>
		
		<p>Hello! I'm Connor, a game programmer and designer and have been making interactive experiences since I was 14. I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology 
		with a Bachelors in Game Design and am currently working on several personal projects such as Itheria.</p>
		
		<p>Here there are several examples of personal and academic projects that I have made either by myself or as part of a larger team in a variety of languages and engines.
		Ever since I was allowed to create an interactive experience in Python as a school project in the 8th grade, I have always loved learning new programming styles and
		improving my skills.</p>
