		<h2>Mumbo Jumbo Magic</h2>
		
		<p>Mumbo Jumbo Magic was a semester-long project that took place during my time at RIT. As part of a team of 4, we were responsible for creating a concept, building a 
		complete experience, and developing a separate level editor.</p>
		
		<p>My part in the project was the overall organization of the project and development of the several game mechanics including the magic system.</p>

		<p>The concept behind the magic system was to allow players more customizability in how they play the game. So there were three main spells: a fireball, an ice shard, and 
		a mana bolt. Fireball setting enemies (and eventually structures) on fire, Ice shard freezing enemies and water, and the Mana Bolt being a good damage dealer.</p>
