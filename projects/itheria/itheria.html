		<h2>Itheria</h2>
		
		<p>Itheria is an on-going personal project that aims to try and address the problems with current adventure games such as the world feeling handcrafted for the player 
		and only active when the player is present. </p>
		
		<p>For instance, in Skyrim it doesnâ€™t matter whether you rush through the main game with breakneck pace or spend hundreds of days in game mining, smithing, sharpening, 
		and enchanting the best possible set of weapons and armor, Alduin will still show up in the expected places doing the same thing.</p>

		<p>Similarly, the NPCs in the games leave a lot to desire regarding interactions, feeling incredibly shallow. This is done for very good reasons, such as time, money, and performance 
		(Why put incredibly in depth features that only a handful of players will ever see).</p>

		<p>As such this game is aiming to make the player feel more like a participant in an ever-changing world rather than the sole driving force behind it.</p>
