		<h2>Changeling</h2>
		
		<p>Changeling is a VR narrative mystery game being developed in the Unreal Engine by students and staff of the Rochester Institute of Technologyâ€™s IGME department. 
		I was brought onto the project as part of a summer internship in 2021.</p>
		
		<p>My contribution to the project was as part of the HOGs team responsible for refining the code of previous development cycles, ensuring data transference between levels, 
		and fixing bugs discovered by other teams.</p>
