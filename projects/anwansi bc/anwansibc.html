		<h2>Anwansi Battle Calculator</h2>
		
		<p>The Anwansi Battle Calculator was a personal program developed for a nation rp game that I helped create. The program itself enabled a straightforward battle system 
		for handling wars between nations.</p>
		
		<p>The players would start on a world map of the game, creating and maneuvering armies around until the two sides came into conflict. Then the program would then generate 
		a procedural terrain map for the two armies to fight on a smaller, more tactical scale.</p>

		<p>The game at the time was set in the classical period of history, so the armies were broken into cohorts. The players would take turns moving and attacking, with aggressors 
		going and then defenders.</p>

		<p>Each individual battle between cohorts would result in one being forced back and both taking casualties. They may also take morale damage, eventually routing from the field entirely. 
		Battles would end after 12 turns had passed, one side retreats, or one side is completely routed.</p>
