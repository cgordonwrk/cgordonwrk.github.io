		<h2>Revengeance Battle Calculator</h2>
		
		<p>The Revengeance Battle is the successor to the Anwansi Battle Calculator, designed for the next season of the nation rp game. Similarly to the first, this program 
		enables a straightforward battle system.</p>
		
		<p>However, unlike the Anwansi calculator, this one doesnâ€™t include the smaller-scale tactical combat. All combat is resolved on the world map by pitting two sides 
		against each other. The reason is that the tactical combat was found to be incredibly cumbersome for moderate to large scale battles.</p>
